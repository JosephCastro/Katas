# FizzBuzz

You need to iterate from 1 to 100, and print these numbers, each in one line, but if the number is divisible by 3, instead of printing the number, you need to print **Fizz**.
If the number is divisible by 5, you need to print **Buzz** and if the number is divisible by 3 and 5, you need to print **FizzBuzz**.
